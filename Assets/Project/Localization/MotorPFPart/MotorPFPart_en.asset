    m_Localized: 'Welcome to the familiarization module! Here, you''ll transform
      into a seasoned mechanic, gaining an intimate understanding of an motor''s
      inner workings.


      The tablet UI acts as your interactive handbook. Tap
      on specific components with your right-hand ray to access in-depth information.

      Grab
      the tablet and move around in the scene.


      Use your left-hand ray to
      hover on individual motor components displayed in a stunning 3D environment.

      As
      you hover your ray over a component, it will highlight, revealing its name
      and a concise description displayed on the tablet UI.'

  - m_Id: 32577877848064
    m_Localized: A DC machine is an electromechanical energy conversion device, which
      converts electrical energy to mechanical energy and vice-versa.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 32610362732544
    m_Localized: The terminal box is used to connect the armature and field winding
      to the external circuit and it is situated on the yoke.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 32624585617408
    m_Localized: Pole core carries a field winding to produce the flux and pole shoe
      enlarges the area to produce larger induced emf.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 32639248904192
    m_Localized: The function of a commutator is to converts the induced alternating
      current in the armature winding into unidirectional current in generator action,
      whereas in motor its vice-versa

  - m_Id: 32655896096768
    m_Localized: The function of the armature core is to offer a path for the magnetic
      field flux with minimal reluctance.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 32676158779392
    m_Localized: The armature winding conduct current over the field, thus generating
      shaft torque in motoring and also produce Electromotive Force.
